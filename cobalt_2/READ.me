This program is a research aide that aims to streamline initial genome gathering via ncbi.
cobalt_2 can be used via two options:

Option 1) allows the user to run by specifying domain and search for classification to download assembly summaries
in real-time.

Option 2) allows the user to run from pre-downloaded assembly summaries
from either:

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/

and/or

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/


Future versions of the cobalt compiler will aim to allow the user to
a) update pre-existing datasets
b) add publications of interest to a specified directory and compile data through accession pathways
as specified in data accessibility sections
c) user option to gather amino acid translations (.faa) or choose to run prodigal predictions
d) run prokka with (.gff) settings to calculate CD%, and run CheckM to calculate %completeness and %contamination

Quick Tutorial:
*SUGGESTED .bashrc alias: alias cobalt_2="source ~/cobalt_2/cobalt_2.2.sh"

Option 1)
1a. Run command with .bashrc alias
	"cobalt_2"
	NOTE: cobalt will generate your project directory specified during option

1b. Run command without .bashrc alias
	"source cobalt_2/cobalt_2.2.sh"
	NOTE: cobalt will generate your project directory specified during option

2. Choose domain

3. Choose to add assembly summaries
	NOTE: If you have pre-existing assembly summaries verify these are located in your home directory at time of program run

4. Choose ftp site

5. Search organism
	NOTE: Case sensitive search. Best to search work case sensitive string

6. Choose a secondary ftp site OR continue

7. Choose options for subgroup separation

options:
- cobalt_2 will prompt the user if there is a specified subgroup in the dataset that
should be copied to a separate subdirectory (See example tutorial).
- If you would like to separate after initial dump separate_subgroup.sh should be run
from the project directory.


Option 2)
1. Download
	Download desired assembly_summaries from genbank and refseq (ftp)

2. Move
	Move assembly_summaries into your home directory (~)

3a. Run command with .bashrc alias
	"cobalt_2 <directory name>"
	NOTE: cobalt will generate your project directory given the first command option

3b. Run command without .bashrc alias
	"source cobalt_2/cobalt_2.2.sh <directory name>"
	NOTE: cobalt will generate your project directory given the first command option

4. Choose options for subgroup separation

options:
- cobalt_2 will prompt the user if there is a specified subgroup in the dataset that
should be copied to a separate subdirectory (See example tutorial).
- If you would like to separate after initial dump separate_subgroup.sh should be run
from the project directory.

Example Test

1) You are investigating Asgard Archaea and due to a recent publication you've decided
to begin by charaterizing Heimdall
2) Run cobalt_2 as specified in the tutorials
3) Choose Bacteria with "a"
4) Choose yes with "y"
5) Choose Genbank with "g"
6) Type "Odin" (Don't worry. We're covering all the bases here.)
7) Choose Genbank with "g"
8) Type "Thor"
9) Choose Genbank with "g"
10) Type "Loki"
11) Choose Genbank with "g"
12) Type "Hela"
13) Choose Genbank with "g"
14) Type "Heimdall"
15) Choose continue with "c"
16) Type "asgard" to name project directory
17) Choose yes with "y"
18) Type "Heimdall"
19) Choose No with "n"

CONGRATULATIONS! You now have a clean/functional asgard project directory with a subdirectory of copied Heimdall data.
By doing so you can begin your analysis (pangenome assembly perhaps) investigating only Heimdall. Retaining the
asgard superphylum in one set will allow you investigate the group as a whole while Retaining the integrity and
cleanliness of your specified subdirectory. HAPPY MINING!


Ideas for seaprating subgroups:
- TARA OCEANS MAGs by bio-geographical abbreviation
- groups within phyla with high variability at the population level (open pangenomes)
- etc.

refseq vs genbank protocol:

Depending on the target organism results may vary as some sub-directories in refseq are
categorized differently. Verify before use that any combination of refseq and genbank
assembly_summaries are categorized in similar sub-directories.
