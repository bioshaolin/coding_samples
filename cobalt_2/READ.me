This program is a research aide that aims to streamline initial genome compilation. cobalt_2
allows the user to compile a project directory built from pre-downloaded assembly summaries
from either:

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/

and/or

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/

Future versions of the cobalt compiler will aim to allow the user to specify an assembly
summary search to further streamline genome compilation and put valuable time back into
the hands of scientific inquiry.

Quick Tutorial:

1. Download
	Download desired assembly_summaries from genbank and refseq (ftp)

2. Move
	Move assembly_summaries into your home directory (~)

3a. Run command with .bashrc alias
	"cobalt_2 <directory name>"
	NOTE: cobalt will generate your project directory given the first command option

3b. Run command without .bashrc alias
	"source cobalt_2/cobalt_2.1.sh <directory name>"
	NOTE: cobalt will generate your project directory given the first command option

4. Choose options for subgroup separation

options:
- cobalt_2 will prompt the user if there is a specified subgroup in the dataset that
should be copied to a separate subdirectory (See example tutorial).
- If you would like to separate after initial dump separate_subgroup.sh should be run
from the project directory.

Example Test (test_dir):

1) you've downloaded a set of Asgard Archaea assembly summaries
2) move assembly summaries to home directory and run cobalt_2
3a) You are planning on beginning your investigation specifically studying Heimdall and
you would prefer a separate directory with Heimdall genomes
3b) When prompted, "Search, Copy and Separate a subgroup?" - type y for yes
4) When prompted, "What Subgroup?" - type Heimdall
NOTE: This copies all Heimdall specific data in the project directory and creates your
refined project subdirectory.
NOTE: The separate_subgroup user option is case sensitive as the inquiry correlates directly
with gbff metadata (i.e - typing heimdall will return error message,
"No subgroup identified by given parameter. Try another...").
5) When prompted again, "Search, Copy and Separate a subgroup?" -
type y for another subgroup search or n to exit program

Ideas for seaprating subgroups:
- TARA OCEANS MAGs by bio-geographical abbreviation
- groups within phyla with high variability at the population level (open pangenomes)
- etc.

refseq vs genbank protocol:

Depending on the target organism results may vary as some sub-directories in refseq are
categorized differently. Verify before use that any combination of refseq and genbank
assembly_summaries are categorized in similar sub-directories.
